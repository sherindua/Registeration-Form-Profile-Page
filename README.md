## Initial Setup

- Update the .env file with your own mongodb url & add the name of your collection b/w '?' and the '/' preceeding the '?'.
- For example, in the existing mongo_url , the name of the collection in my database is 'user_data'

## How to run?

- open the terminal when you are on root folder
- write 'npm start' and hit enter

## If there's any error in running start or npm

- hit 'npm install' in console to install any missing stuff
